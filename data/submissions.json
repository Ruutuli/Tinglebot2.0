Elde’s been studying them, they think that stuff is pretty neat.\"\n- \"Lizalfos parts, from the kinds found in and around the forest. But we need **50 of each!** Show Elde how much you’re helping!\"\n- \"Did you know Elde has a favourite Beetle? It has great big mandibles and is the colour of the sky, but it’s not easy to find. You should bring back a few of them, perhaps **5 would do?**\"",
