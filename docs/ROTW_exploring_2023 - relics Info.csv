Tattered Diary: Entry 12,1,"**__Tattered Diary Entry 12__**

Last night, something strange happened. I was alone, gazing at the moon, when I heard a voice. It whispered to me, telling me I'm different, that I have a power to change Hyrule's fate. At first, I didn't believe it. Me, special? But then, I saw it happen. The blight, once terrifying, obeyed my command as if I were its master.

It's unsettling, this realization of power. Yet, deep down, I feel its truth. I am not ordinary. I possess a unique ability to shape the world around me.

Others may fear what I can do, but I am not afraid. I will wield this power to bring about change, to mold Hyrule according to my will. The voice spoke the truth. I am destined for greatness, and I will not be deterred.
